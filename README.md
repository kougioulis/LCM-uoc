## Abstract

Causal discovery for both cross-sectional and temporal data has traditionally followed a dataset-specific paradigm, where a new model is fitted for each individual dataset. Such an approach underutilizes the potential of multi-dataset and large-scale pretraining, especially given recent advances in foundation models. The concept of Large Causal Models (LCMs) envisions a class of pre-trained neural architectures specifically designed for temporal causal discovery. Existing approaches remain largely proofs of concept, typically constrained to small input sizes (e.g., five variables), with performance degrading rapidly to random guessing as the number of variables or model parameters increases. Moreover, current methods rely heavily on synthetic data, generated under arbitrary assumptions, which substantially limits their ability to generalize to realistic or out-of-distribution samples. This work addresses these challenges through novel methods for training on mixtures of synthetic and realistic data collections, enabling both higher input dimensionality and deeper architectures without loss of performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LCMs achieve competitive or superior performance compared to classical causal discovery algorithms, while maintaining robustness across diverse domains, especially on non-synthetic data cases. Our findings also highlight promising directions towards integrating interventional samples and domain knowledge, further advancing the development of foundation models for causal discovery.

## Contributions

### Large Causal Models
* Introduced **Large Causal Models (LCMs)**; a family of scalable, pre-trained neural architectures for temporal causal discovery, under a supervised paradigm.
* Demonstrated that LCMs achieve **strong zero-shot performance**, **robustness** to domain shift, and remain **competitive or superior** against established causal discovery benchmarks.

### Data Generation

* Developed a **high-fidelity** *synthetic* temporal SCM generation pipeline to support large-scale supervised training of LCMs.
* Developed and utilized [**Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS)**](https://github.com/kougioulis/TCS): a generative methodology for creating *simulated* (*realistic*) causal models and corresponding datasets from real multivariate time series samples.
  - **TCS** is used as a **causal model generation mechanism** to augment training of LCMs with realistic (ground truth TSCM, ground truth data) pairs
  - As part of TCS, developed and employed a **causal model selection** (tuning) methodology **(Adversarial Causal Tuning - ACT)** that selects the *optimal causal model* under a *Min-max* scheme on the space of *Classifier 2-sample tests (C2STs)*, treated as discriminators. 
  - ACT functions as an optimal **causal model selection criterion**, **rather than a generative method**, and is therefore a subcomponent of TCS. 
  - Framed **TCS as a principled approach towards causal digital twins**, aiming to generate samples that are statistically indistinguishable from real data while remaining causally interpretable.

### Training at Scale

* Generated *hundreds of thousands* of (data, graph) training pairs, including synthetic and simulated (using TCS).
* Demonstrated that **mixtures** of *synthetic* and *realistic* training data **significantly improve generalization** and zero-shot performance.
* Identified **optimal** synthetic/realistic mixing **ratios**, that align with findings of works on time-series forecasting foundation models.

* Proposed a novel regularizing term to suppress low-support edges and aid model performance.
* Experimentally showed that using observed statistics during training and inference **improves model performance**.

### Comparison with Existing Approaches

* **Benchmarked** against established methods in temporal causal discovery and showcased competitive or superior performance across synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic datasets
* Demonstrated robustness under domain shift and zero-shot performance.

### Efficiency

* Achieved **significantly faster runtimes** than classical temporal causal discovery methods, thus opening the path to real-time applications.

## Notebooks

`experimental_results.ipynb` contains the experimental results of Section 6.5.

`illustrative_example.ipynb` contains an example of loading a pre-trained LCM, preprocessing a simple synthetic input time-series data and performing causal discovery. It illustrates both the discovered lagged causal graph, as well as the confidence weights of the lagged adjacency tensor and the $AUC$ of the model.

`ablation_experiments.ipynb` contains ablation experiments (Section 6.4.1) and zero-shot experiments on assessing the optimal mixture of realistic and synthetic training data (Section 6.4.2).

## Quick Start

This section demonstrates how to load a pretrained LCM and perform temporal causal discovery on a small illustrative time-series example. The goal is to show a minimal workflow. For a complete, end-to-end example with visualizations and evaluation metrics, see `illustrative_example.ipynb`.

1. Load a pretrained model

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import torch
sys.path.append("..") # Add project root to PYTHONPATH

from src.modules.lcm_module import LCMModule # import the model

model_path = Path("/path/to/pretrained/checkpoints") # Path to pretrained models (adjust)

# Load an LCM
model = LCMModule.load_from_checkpoint(
    model_path / "LCM_2.5M.ckpt"
)

device = "cpu" 
M = model.model.to(device).eval()
```

2. Load the data

```python
from src.utils.misc_utils import run_illustrative_example

# Model-specific params
MAX_SEQ_LEN = 500
MAX_LAG = 3
MAX_VAR = 12

X_cpd, Y_cpd = run_illustrative_example(n=MAX_SEQ_LEN)
X_cpd = torch.tensor(X_cpd.values, dtype=torch.float32)
```

3. Preprocess the data (normalization and sequence padding)

```python
# Normalize and pad
X_cpd = (X_cpd - X_cpd.min()) / (X_cpd.max() - X_cpd.min())

# Noise padding  
if X_cpd.shape[0] < MAX_SEQ_LEN:
    X_cpd = torch.cat([X_cpd, torch.normal(0, 0.01, (MAX_SEQ_LEN - X_cpd.shape[0], X_cpd.shape[1]))], dim=0)

VAR_DIF, LAG_DIF = MAX_VAR - X_cpd.shape[1], MAX_LAG - Y_cpd.shape[2]
if VAR_DIF > 0:
    X_cpd = torch.cat([X_cpd, torch.normal(0, 0.01, (X_cpd.shape[0], VAR_DIF))], dim=1)
    Y_cpd = torch.nn.functional.pad(Y_cpd, (0, 0, 0, VAR_DIF, 0, VAR_DIF), value=0.0)
```

3. Run inference (causal discovery)

```python
from src.utils.utils import lagged_batch_crosscorrelation

with torch.no_grad():
    corr = lagged_batch_crosscorrelation(X_cpd.unsqueeze(0), MAX_LAG)
    pred = torch.sigmoid(M((X_cpd.unsqueeze(0), corr)))
    for l in range(pred.shape[-1]):
        pred[:,l,l] = 0
```

4. Compute performance metrics

```python
from src.utils.metrics import custom_binary_metrics

print(f'AUC: {custom_binary_metrics(pred, Y_cpd)[0]}')
```

The output pred is a lagged adjacency tensor, where each slice corresponds to causal effects at a specific time lag. Higher values indicate stronger confidence in a directed causal relationship. For visualization of the predicted graphs, comparison to ground truth, and additional experiments (ablations, zero-shot transfer, realistic datasets), refer to the accompanying notebooks.
