## 📌 Overview

## TLDR; - Our contributions

Contributions of this dissertation can be summarized as follows:

- Introduced a family of pre-trained neural architectures (**Large Causal Models - LCMs**) capable of performing causal discovery on time-series data, scaling to significantly larger numbers of variables than prior work, without degradation in performance compared to prior work.

- Developed a pipeline for **generating synthetic data of high fidelity** (time-series samples derived from a ground truth temporal SCM).

- Introduced a **novel AutoML-based generative method (Temporal Causal-based Simulation - TCS) for creating realistic (simulated) causal models and coressponding data samples from real, multivariate time-series**.

- Proposed an **adversarial discriminator methodology using Classifier 2-Sample Tests - C2STs (Adversarial Causal Tuning - ACT)** for *optimal causal model selection from TCS** and avoid selection of degenerate, fully-connected graps **(sparsity penalty)**.

- Generated **hundreds of thousands of training pairs** from mixtures of synthetic and simulated datasets, enabling robust multi-domain pretraining of LCMs.

- Showcased that **training of causal foundation models benefits from a mixture of both synthetic and realistic data**, as illustrated in foundation models for time-series forecasting. Identified the optimal ratio for this mixture, which improves generalization to semi-synthetic and realistic benchmarks.

- **Proposed a lagged-correlation-informed regularization technique** that stabilizes training and suppresses low-support edges in predicted causal graphs, motivated by prior work, and showcased that the **use of observed statistics (training aids) during both training and inference of causal foundation models improves performance**.

- **Compared LCMs against well-known causal discovery methods** (e.g., PCMCI, DYNOTEARS) and demonstrated **competitive or superior performance** across synthetic, semi-synthetic and realistic datasets, maintaining robustness under domain shifts and distributions outside the training set; one of the first results for causal foundation models in temporal data.

- Achieved **significantly faster inference time** than existing non-foundation temporal causal discovery algorithms.

- Designed a novel transformer-based model using *patch embeddings, variable embeddings, and multi-head temporal–spatial attention for improved expressivity* and generalization **(preliminary experiments)**.

- Proposed promising approaches for *incorporating interventional data in foundation models for causal discovery* **(preliminary experiments)**.

- Designed promising mechanisms for *representation and training to integrate prior domain knowledge*, as a soft auxiliary task **(preliminary experiments)**.

## 🧪 Setup & Getting Started 

### 🐍 Conda Environment

We provide a conda environment for reproducibility purposes. One can create a virtual conda environment using
